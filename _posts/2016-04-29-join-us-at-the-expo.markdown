We are working on fashioning a DIY neon sign using electroluminescent (EL) wire to match the EMG logo. Things I wish I knew before ordering materials:

1. [This inverter][loud-inverter] from Adafruit made an awful, awful sound that would not be tolerable by anyone in a 100 foot radius. Having never worked with EL wire, my quick consult with Google told me that the inverters are indeed audible. Audible. Not eardrum piercing. A new attempt with this [power supply/inverter combo][good-inverter] was far more successful.
2. [Thicker wire is not brighter than thinner wire.][brightness] It’s a tradeoff between thickness and brightness. We chose 5mm to resemble a neon sign more closely, but if you’re looking for bright, go with 2.6mm.
3. Wire length affects brightness as well. Above, the left image shows 20 feet of 5mm EL wire, and the right image shows the same wire after it was cut to 10 feet.
